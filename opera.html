            (Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller from Westminster Hall.)

            CELIA.  You seem annoyed.
            LORD MOUNT.  Annoyed!  I should think so!  Why, this
       ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!
       To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
       open to Competitive Examination!
            LORD TOLL.  And he'll carry it, too!
            LORD MOUNT.  Carry it?  Of course he will!  He's a
       Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!
            LEILA.  Yes.  If you please, that's our fault!
            LORD MOUNT.  The deuce it is!
            CELIA.  Yes; we influence the members, and compel them to vote
       just as he wishes them to.
            LEILA.  It's our system.  It shortens the debates.
            LORD TOLL.  Well, but think what it all means.  I don't so
       much mind for myself, but with a House of Peers with no
       grandfathers worth mentioning, the country must go to the dogs!
            LEILA.  I suppose it must!
            LORD MOUNT.  I don't want to say a word against brains—I've
       a great respect for brains—I often wish I had some myself—but
       with a House of Peers composed exclusively of people of intellect,
       what's to become of the House of Commons?
            LEILA.  I never thought of that!
            LORD MOUNT.  This comes of women interfering in politics.  It
       so happens that if there is an institution in Great Britain which
       is not susceptible of any improvement at all, it is the House of
       Peers!
     
                            SONG—LORD MOUNTARARAT.
     
                 When Britain really ruled the waves—
                      (In good Queen Bess's time)
                 The House of Peers made no pretence
                 To intellectual eminence,
                      Or scholarship sublime;
                 Yet Britain won her proudest bays
                 In good Queen Bess's glorious days!
     
       CHORUS.        Yes, Britain won, etc.
     
                 When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte,
                      As every child can tell,
                 The House of Peers, throughout the war,
                 Did nothing in particular,
                      And did it very well:
                 Yet Britain set the world ablaze
                 In good King George's glorious days!
     
       CHORUS.        Yes, Britain set, etc.
     
                 And while the House of Peers withholds
                      Its legislative hand,
                 And noble statesmen do not itch
                 To interfere with matters which
                      They do not understand,
                 As bright will shine Great Britain's rays
                 As in King George's glorious days!
     
       CHORUS.        As bright will shine, etc.
     
            LEILA. (who has been much attracted by the Peers during this
       song).  Charming persons, are they not?
            CELIA.  Distinctly.  For self-contained dignity, combined with
       airy condescension, give me a British Representative Peer!
            LORD TOLL.  Then pray stop this protege of yours before it's
       too late.  Think of the mischief you're doing!
            LEILA (crying).  But we can't stop him now.  (Aside to Celia.)
       Aren't they lovely!  (Aloud.)  Oh, why did you go and defy us, you
       great geese!
     
                            DUET—LEILA and CELIA.
     
       LEILA.              In vain to us you plead—
                                          Don't go!
                           Your prayers we do not heed—
                                          Don't go!
                                It's true we sigh,
                                     But don't suppose
                                A tearful eye
                                     Forgiveness shows.
                                          Oh, no!
                           We're very cross indeed—
                                Yes, very cross,
                                          Don't go!
     
       FAIRIES.                 It's true we sigh, etc.
     
       CELIA.              Your disrespectful sneers—
                                          Don't go!
                           Call forth indignant tears—
                                          Don't go!
                                You break our laws—
                                     You are our foe:
                                We cry because
                                     We hate you so!
                                          You know!
                           You very wicked Peers!
                                You wicked Peers!
                                          Don't go!
     
            FAIRIES.                      LORDS MOUNT. and TOLL.
     
       You break our laws—          Our disrespectful sneers,
            You are our foe:                   Ha, ha!
       We cry because                Call forth indignant tears,
            We hate you so!                    Ha, ha!
                      You know!      If that's the case, my dears—
       You very wicked Peers!   FAIRIES.  Don't go!
                      Don't go! PEERS.    We'll go!
     
       (Exeunt Lord Mountararat, Lord Tolloller, and Peers.  Fairies gaze
       wistfully after them.)
     
                               (Enter Fairy Queen.)
     
            QUEEN.  Oh, shame—shame upon you!  Is this your fidelity to
       the laws you are bound to obey?  Know ye not that it is death to
       marry a mortal?
            LEILA.  Yes, but it's not death to wish to marry a mortal!
            FLETA.  If it were, you'd have to execute us all!
            QUEEN.  Oh, this is weakness!  Subdue it!
            CELIA.  We know it's weakness, but the weakness is so strong!
            LEILA.  We are not all as tough as you are!
            QUEEN.  Tough!  Do you suppose that I am insensible to the
       effect of manly beauty?  Look at that man!  (Referring to Sentry.)
       A perfect picture!  (To Sentry.)  Who are you, sir?
            WILLIS (coming to "attention").  Private Willis, B Company,
       1st Grenadier Guards.
            QUEEN.  You're a very fine fellow, sir.
            WILLIS.  I am generally admired.
            QUEEN.  I can quite understand it.  (To Fairies.)  Now here is
       a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike.  That man has
       a most extraordinary effect upon me.  If I yielded to a natural
       impulse, I should fall down and worship that man.  But I mortify
       this inclination; I wrestle with it, and it lies beneath my feet!
       That is how I treat my regard for that man!
     
                              SONG—FAIRY QUEEN.
     
                           Oh, foolish fay,
                                Think you, because
                           His brave array
                                My bosom thaws,
                           I'd disobey
                                Our fairy laws?
                           Because I fly
                                In realms above,
                           In tendency
                                To fall in love,
                           Resemble I
                                The amorous dove?
       (Aside.)            Oh, amorous dove!
                                Type of Ovidius Naso!
                                     This heart of mine
                                     Is soft as thine,
                           Although I dare not say so!
     
       CHORUS.             Oh, amorous dove, etc.
     
                           On fire that glows
                                With heat intense
                           I turn the hose
                                Of common sense,
                           And out it goes
                                At small expense!
                           We must maintain
                                Our fairy law;
                           That is the main
                                On which to draw—
                           In that we gain
                                A Captain Shaw!
       (Aside.)                 Oh, Captain Shaw!
                                     Type of true love kept under!
                                          Could thy Brigade
                                          With cold cascade
                                     Quench my great love, I wonder!
     
       CHORUS.             Oh, Captain Shaw! etc.
     
                    (Exeunt Fairies and Fairy Queen, sorrowfully.)
     
                                  (Enter Phyllis.)
     
            PHYL.  (half crying).  I can't think why I'm not in better
       spirits.  I'm engaged to two noblemen at once.  That ought to be
       enough to make any girl happy.  But I'm miserable!  Don't suppose
       it's because I care for Strephon, for I hate him!  No girl could
       care for a man who goes about with a mother considerably younger
       than himself!
     
                   (Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller.)
     
            LORD MOUNT.  Phyllis!  My darling!
            LORD TOLL.  Phyllis!  My own!
            PHYL.  Don't!  How dare you?  Oh, but perhaps you're the two
       noblemen I'm engaged to?
            LORD MOUNT.  I am one of them.
            LORD TOLL.  I am the other.
            PHYL.  Oh, then, my darling!  (to Lord Mountararat).  My own!
       (to Lord Tolloller).  Well, have you settled which it's to be?
            LORD TOLL.  Not altogether.  It's a difficult position.  It
       would be hardly delicate to toss up.  On the whole we would rather
       leave it to you.
            PHYL.  How can it possibly concern me?  You are both EarIs,
       and you are both rich, and you are both plain.
            LORD MOUNT.  So we are.  At least I am.
            LORD TOLL.  So am I.
            LORD MOUNT.  No, no!
            LORD TOLL.  I am indeed.  Very plain.
            LORD MOUNT.  Well, well—perhaps you are.
            PHYL.  There's really nothing to choose between you.  If one
       of you would forgo his title, and distribute his estates among his
       Irish tenantry, why, then, I should then see a reason for accepting
       the other.
            LORD MOUNT.  Tolloller, are you prepared to make this
       sacrifice?
            LORD TOLL.  No!
            LORD MOUNT.  Not even to oblige a lady?
            LORD TOLL.  No! not even to oblige a lady.
            LORD MOUNT.  Then, the only question is, which of us shall
       give way to the other?  Perhaps, on the whole, she would be happier
       with me.  I don't know.  I may be wrong.
            LORD TOLL.  No.  I don't know that you are.  I really believe
       she would.  But the awkward part of the thing is that if you rob me
       of the girl of my heart, we must fight, and one of us must die.
       It's a family tradition that I have sworn to respect.  It's a
       painful position, for I have a very strong regard for you, George.
            LORD MOUNT. (much affected).  My dear Thomas!
            LORD TOLL.  You are very dear to me, George.  We were boys
       together—at least I was.  If I were to survive you, my existence
       would be hopelessly embittered.
            LORD MOUNT.  Then, my dear Thomas, you must not do it.  I say
       it again and again—if it will have this effect upon you, you must
       not do it.  No, no.  If one of us is to destroy the other, let it
       be me!
            LORD TOLL.  No, no!
            LORD MOUNT.  Ah, yes!—by our boyish friendship I implore you!
            LORD TOLL. (much moved).  Well, well, be it so.  But,
       no—no!—I cannot consent to an act which would crush you with
       unavaillng remorse.
            LORD MOUNT.  But it would not do so.  I should be very sad at
       first—oh, who would not be?—but it would wear off.  I like you
       very much—but not, perhaps, as much as you like me.
            LORD TOLL.  George, you're a noble fellow, but that tell-tale
       tear betrays you.  No, George; you are very fond of me, and I
       cannot consent to give you a week's uneasiness on my account.
            LORD MOUNT.  But, dear Thomas, it would not last a week!
       Remember, you lead the House of Lords!  On your demise I shall take
       your place!  Oh, Thomas, it would not last a day!
            PHYL. (coming down).  Now, I do hope you're not going to fight
       about me, because it's really not worth while.
            LORD TOLL. (looking at her).  Well, I don't believe it is!
            LORD MOUNT.  Nor I.  The sacred ties of Friendship are
       paramount.
