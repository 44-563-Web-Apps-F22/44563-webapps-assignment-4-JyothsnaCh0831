          <h5>CELIA.</h5>
          <p>You seem annoyed.</p>
          <h5>LORD MOUNT.</h5>
          <p>
               Annoyed! I should think so! Why, this
               ridiculous protege of yours is playing the deuce with everything!<br>
               To-night is the second reading of his Bill to throw the Peerage
               open to Competitive Examination!
          </p>
          <h5>LORD TOLL.</h5>
          <p>And he'll carry it, too!</p>
          <h5>LORD MOUNT.</h5>
          <p> 
               Carry it? Of course he will! He's a
               Parliamentary Pickford—he carries everything!
          </p>
          <h6>RECITATIVE—LORD MOUNT.</h6>
          <h5>LEILA.</h5>
          <p> Yes. If you please, that's our fault!</p>
          <h5>LORD MOUNT.</h5>
          <p>The deuce it is!</p>
          <h5>CELIA.</h5>
          <p> 
               Yes; we influence the members, and compel them to vote
               just as he wishes them to.
          </p>
          <h5>LEILA.</h5>
          <p>It's our system. It shortens the debates.</p>
          <h5>LORD TOLL.</h5>
          <p> 
               Well, but think what it all means. I don't so
               much mind for myself, <br>but with a House of Peers with no
               grandfathers worth mentioning, the country must go to the dogs!
          </p>
          <h5>LEILA.</h5>
          <p>I suppose it must!</p>
          <h5>LORD MOUNT.</h5>
          <p>
               I don't want to say a word against brains—I've
               a great respect for brains—<br>I often wish I had some myself—but
               with a House of Peers composed exclusively of people of intellect,<br>
               what's to become of the House of Commons?
          </p>
          <h5>LEILA.</h5>
          <p>I never thought of that!</p>
          <h5>LORD MOUNT.</h5>
          <p>
               This comes of women interfering in politics. It
               so happens that if there is an institution in Great Britain which<br>
               is not susceptible of any improvement at all, it is the House of
               Peers!
          </p>
          <h6>SONG—LORD MOUNTARARAT.</h6>
          <p>
               <pre>
                    When Britain really ruled the waves—
                    The House of Peers made no pretence
                    To intellectual eminence,
                    Or scholarship sublime;
                    Yet Britain won her proudest bays
                    In good Queen Bess's glorious days!
               </pre>
          </p>
          <h6>CHORUS. Yes, Britain won, etc.</h6>
          <p>
               (Exeunt Lord Mountararat, Lord Tolloller, and Peers. Fairies gaze
               wistfully after them.)
          </p>
          <p>
               <pre>
                    When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte,
                    As every child can tell,
                    The House of Peers, throughout the war,
                    Did nothing in particular,
                    And did it very well:                         
                    Yet Britain set the world ablaze
                    In good King George's glorious days!
               </pre>
          </p>
          <h6>CHORUS. Yes, Britain set, etc.</h6>
          <p>
               (Enter Fairy Queen.)
          </p>
          <h5> QUEEN.</h5>
          <p>
               Oh, shame—shame upon you! Is this your fidelity to
               the laws you are bound to obey?<br> Know ye not that it is death to
               marry a mortal?
          </p>
          <h5>LEILA.</h5>
          <p>Yes, but it's not death to wish to marry a mortal!</p>
          <h5>FLETA.</h5>
          <p>If it were, you'd have to execute us all!</p>
          <h5>QUEEN.</h5>
          <p>Oh, this is weakness! Subdue it!</p>
          <h5>CELIA.</h5>
          <p>We know it's weakness, but the weakness is so strong!</p>
          <h5>LEILA.</h5>
          <p>We are not all as tough as you are!</p>
          <p>
               <pre>
                    And while the House of Peers withholds
                    Its legislative hand,
                    And noble statesmen do not itch
                    To interfere with matters which
                    They do not understand,
                    As bright will shine Great Britain's rays
                    As in King George's glorious days!
               </pre>
          </p>
          <h6>CHORUS. As bright will shine, etc.</h6>
          <p>
               (Exeunt Fairies and Fairy Queen, sorrowfully.)
               <br>
               (Enter Phyllis.)
          </p>
          <h5>LEILA.</h5>
          <p>
               (who has been much attracted by the Peers during this
               song).
          </p>
          <p>Charming persons, are they not?</p>
          <h5>CELIA.</h5>
          <p>
               Distinctly. For self-contained dignity, combined with
               airy condescension, give me a British Representative Peer!
          </p>
          <h5>LORD TOLL.</h5>
          <p>
               Then pray stop this protege of yours before it's
               too late. Think of the mischief you're doing!
          </p>
          <h6> DUET—LEILA and CELIA.</h6>
          <p>
               <pre>
                    In vain to us you plead—
                    Don't go!
                    Your prayers we do not heed—
                    Don't go!
                    It's true we sigh,
                    But don't suppose
                    A tearful eye
                    Forgiveness shows.
                    Oh, no!
                    We're very cross indeed—
                    Yes, very cross,
                    Don't go!
               </pre>
          </p>
          <h6>FAIRIES. LORDS MOUNT. and TOLL.</h6>
          <p>
               <pre>
                    Your disrespectful sneers—
                    Don't go!
                    Call forth indignant tears—
                    Don't go!
                    You break our laws—
                    You are our foe:
                    We cry because
                    We hate you so!
                    You know!
                    You very wicked Peers!
                    You wicked Peers!
                    Don't go!
               </pre>
          </p>
          <h6>CHORUS. Oh, amorous dove, etc.</h6>
          <p>(Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller.)</p>
          <h5>PHYL.</h5>
          <p>
               Don't! How dare you? Oh, but perhaps you're the two
               noblemen I'm engaged to?
          </p>
          <h5>LORD MOUNT.</h5>
          <p>I am one of them.</p>
          <h5>LORD TOLL.</h5>
          <p>I am the other.</p>
          <h5>PHYL.</h5>
          <p>Oh, then, my darling!. My own! Well, have you settled which it's to be?</p>
          <h5>LORD TOLL.</h5>
          <p>
               Not altogether. It's a difficult position. It
               would be hardly delicate to toss up. On the whole we would rather
               leave it to you.
          </p>
          <h5>PHYL.</h5>
          <p>
               How can it possibly concern me? You are both EarIs,
               and you are both rich, and you are both plain.
          </p>
          <h5>LORD MOUNT.</h5>
          <p>So we are. At least I am.</p>
          <h5>LORD TOLL.</h5>
          <p>So am I.</p>
          <h5>LORD MOUNT.</h5>
          <p>No, no!</p>
          <h5>LORD TOLL.</h5>
          <p>I am indeed. Very plain.</p>
          <h5>LORD MOUNT.</h5>
          <p>Well, well—perhaps you are.</p>
          <h6>QUARTET—LORD MOUNTARARAT,
               LORD TOLLOLLER, PHYLLIS, and PRIVATE WILLIS.</h6>
          <p>
               <pre>
                    Love, unrequited, robs me of my rest:
                    Love, hopeless love, my ardent soul encumbers:
                    Love, nightmare-like, lies heavy on my chest,
                    And weaves itself into my midnight slumbers!
